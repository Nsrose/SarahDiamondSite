            <div class="about-info">I'm a rising senior at American University excited to build a career in business development. I am passionate about working for organizations that focus on environmental awareness, music and the arts, youth advocacy, and education.<br><br>During my undergraduate studies I've lived in Washington D.C. and London to attend the London School of Economics. My professional experience is in business development so I have a strong background in marketing, fundraising, communications and event planning. My favorite aspect of the administrative positions I've held has been integrating youth education into my position. Whether working in a music store, at a nature conservancy, or Hebrew school, I have always treasured the opportunities I have to work directly with kids who are excited to learn.<br><br>I am eager to apply my skills in community outreach and business development to future opportunities.</div>
