            <div class="section-info">I'm a rising senior at American University excited to build a career in business development. I am passionate about working for organizations that focus on environmental awareness, music and the arts, youth advocacy, and education.<br><br>During my undergraduate studies I've lived in Washington D.C. and London, where I attended the London School of Economics. My professional experience is in business development so I have a strong background in marketing, fundraising, communications and event planning. In my administrative work, I am most excited when I am able to integrate youth education. Whether working in a music store, at a nature conservancy or a Hebrew school, I have always treasured the opportunities to work directly with kids who want to learn.<br><br>I am eager to apply my skills in community outreach and business development.</div>
